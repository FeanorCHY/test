Dear Hiring ManagerI am very proficient with C# related development. In my bachelor degree, I focused on learning C#. During that time and I was able to develop system and websites with several businesses. Then, when I came to US for master degree, I got a summer Intern which let me totally know how to combine Microsoft development tools to build a large system. In this Intern Experience, I know how to develop with ASP.net MVC and divide total system into three layers (called Three layers Architecture); And to implement some good functions or user interaction, I learnt a lot how to use AJAX, JavaScript and JQuery with Html and CSS. Also, I learnt how to publish codes on IIS in server and manage a bunch of versions using SVN. In that intern experience, I worked as full track developer and gained abundant experience with C#.The database I prefers to use is Microsoft SQLServer. I used to write a lot of stored procedures in SQLServer and I am very familiar with configuration, syntax and functions of SQLServer. It is now quite easy for me to develop a system using SQLServer.In the last Summer Intern, SSRS is very an important tool. I used Visual Studio 2008 to develop crystal report service.  Data used to fill report template is extracted from MS SQLServer stored procedures. There are some reportsâ€™ layout really interesting such as nested table that pushed me to read a lot from Microsoft API. I will be very glad that I will keep working on it in the future.I know, as a new grad, I cannot make everything perfect. However, I am optimistic about this chance. I can work hard and try my best brain to learn, to get used to this work. I hope you are satisfied with me. I am very eager to hear from you back!Cheers,Hongyuan Cui
